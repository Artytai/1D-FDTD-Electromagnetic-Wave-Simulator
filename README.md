# 1D-FDTD-Electromagnetic-Wave-Simulator
A 1D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation. Users can adjust grid size, CFL factor, source type (sine or Gaussian), frequency, amplitude, material properties, and damping. The simulation visualizes E-field and H-field in real time with a material boundary and energy readout.
